# a simple crud app that displays a list of ski resorts
Task:
Implement a React component that displays a list of ski resorts. The component should allow users to perform CRUD operations on the list of ski resorts using local state. The component should include the following functionality and save all info to local state (No network requests)
1. Display a list of ski resorts, each with the following information: name, location, and number of ski runs.
2. Allow users to add a new ski resort to the list by filling out a form that includes the name, location, and number of ski runs. The form should include client-side validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out.
3. Allow users to edit the information for an existing ski resort.
4. Allow users to delete a ski resort from the list.
5. Style the component to match a provided design.
6. Add new photos of resort through webcam
7. Write some unit test cases
8. Push to git
9. Deploy to a free service to allow us to use the component

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
